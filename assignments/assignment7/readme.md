1. Store your name into a variable, and log it to the console.
2. Create a function that says `"Hello <yourname>."` <yourname> should be a variable.
3. Create an array of four names. Log the second item in the array to the console.
4. Create a for loop that logs the number 1-10 to the console.
5. Loop through your name array, logging each name to the console.
6. Loop through your name array, logging each name that starts with "P" to the console.
7. Create an object called `Car`. `Car` should have an attribute of `doors` with the value `4`. It should also have a method called `honk` that logs "Honk" to the console. Log your object to the console so you can inspect its properties and method.
