# Assignment 4: Flexboxes and Forms, Oh My!

This assignment will help you understand how to use flexboxes to make laying out items easier. Also, you'll practice using form elements.

## Objectives

- Use Flexboxes to construct a better header and navigation
- Create a "Submit a Recipe" page with a form for submitting a recipe

## Instructions

For this assignment, you'll take your existing recipe site and modify the header. You'll also add a new page for submitting recipes.

To complete this assignment, you'll need to: 

- Add an image to your header for your site logo.
- Create navigation for your site, with the links `Home`, `Recipes` and `Submit a Recipe`. Each should link relatively to your pages.
- Use a flexbox to position your header items as follows: all items centered vertically, with the logo on the far left, and the navigation right justified.
- Create a "Submit a Recipe" page, with a form for submitting a recipe. The form should include the following fields:
    - Name (text input)
    - Email (email input)
    - Recipe Category (dropdown/select box)
    - Recipe (textarea)
    - Submit button
