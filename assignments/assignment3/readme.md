#i Assignment 3: Advanced CSS

This assignment will help you practice more advanced CSS concepts, as well as get more comfortable with more complex HTML in multi-page sites. 

## Objectives

- Learn how to include multiple pages on your website and link between them.
- Use styles across multiple pages to keep a consistent look.
- Use the HTML button, hr, img and div elements.
- Use HTML5 tags like `<header>`, `<main>` and `<footer>` to create more semantic HTML.
- Break your CSS files out into separate files, and include into your HTML files.
- Use CSS positioning properties like `float` and `clear` to position elements on the page.
- Use CSS styling rules to create interesting backgrounds and borders on your pages, and to style lists.

## Instructions

For this assignment, you'll begin creating multiple pages - the first of a real website! As with most sites on the web, your site will now have multiple pages that are linked together, allowing users to get access to more content in an organized manner. 

Your site will now include two pages: a homepage that welcomes our users and lists all our recipes, and a recipe page that displays our Buffalo Chicken Dip recipe. 

To complete this assignment, you'll need to: 

- Create a homepage. Name this `index.html`. Your recipe page should now be called `recipe.html`.
- Style your homepage according to the image included below.
- Style your recipe page according to the image included below. 
- Link from your homepage to your recipe page in the recipe list. Link to your homepage in the header title.
